            <p>    Welcome to the Guitar Lessons with Ben home page. Here you’ll find everything you
need to get started strumming along with your favorite songs. We cover a wide range of styles
from classical, to pop, and even jazz for more experienced players. Regardless of your ability
                level and prior knowledge, we’ve got you covered!</p>

<p>     Teaching since 2009, Ben is choosing to share with you some of the most valuable tips
he’s learned along the way to help students reach their fullest potential and truly unlock the
fretboard of the guitar. Keep in mind though, regardless of what lessons are unveiled to you,
nothing will come without your own effort and persistence along the way. But if you’ve got a 
    willingness to learn and the desire to succeed, you’ve come to the right place!</p><p>    I sincerely hope you enjoy the material I’ve decided to share here. If you are just getting
started, make sure to only use lessons marked with *beginner* - as building a strong foundation
is the quickest way to success. It can be tempting to skip ahead and work on more flashy
advanced subjects, but if you take your time developing your rudimentary skills, you’ll get more
bang for your buck in the long run! One thing that always helps me remember this perspective,
is that in karate, the definition of a black-belt is “master of the basics”.</p>
