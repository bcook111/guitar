            <h1>Video Lessons</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our Video Lesson Demo Hub! We’re giving away some of our very best
beginner lessons for absolutely free to help you get started on your instrument. We believe
everyone should have access to at least rudimentary musical knowledge, and are happy to pass
it on to you. Remember to work hard and be persistent! Always be honing in your practice
technique and work towards using your time as efficiently as possible. If you’re just starting out,
take things slow and be sure to fully digest each topic before moving forward.

<p>For our intermediate and advanced videos, we will be featuring two FULL lesson videos
each month. If you want access to more FULL videos, be sure to become a VIP member!
Otherwise, we are still thrilled to be able to provide you a 90 second excerpt from each one,
which can still prove to be valuable to the developing player.</p><p>
Make sure to check in each month for our full featured intermediate and advanced
videos! If there’s something you’d like to see featured, post a poll on Twitter and use
#GuitarLessonsWithBen so we can share it with our users! We will select one user created poll
each month to play a part in deciding what content is created or made available. Feel free to ask
us questions using the same hashtag.</p>
